# Restaurant Page

A simple restaurant homepage built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum.

## Description

This project is a mock restaurant website where all page content is dynamically generated using JavaScript modules. The goal was to practice DOM manipulation, modular JS structure, and bundling with Webpack — without writing static HTML for each section of the page.

The site includes multiple pages (Home, Menu, Contact), and switching between them updates the content without reloading the page.

## Features

* Fully JavaScript-generated content (no inner HTML)
* ES6 Modules for clean, reusable code
* Basic page routing between sections
* Styled with custom CSS
* Bundled using Webpack
